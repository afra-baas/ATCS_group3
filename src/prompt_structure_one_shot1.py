It details her parents and possible ancestry, and takes you chronologically through her life from childhood to her movie career until the end of her life. I saw another documentary about her, but it wasn't as detailed as this one. For example, the other documentary never explained how she passed away, but this one explains that it was due to colon cancer. Narrated in British English, it offered a good timeline on how she lived her life with lots of good scenes and clips of her. \n Based on this review, might the user be recommending the product?
